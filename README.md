# Project Name - Covid-19 Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the spread and early data of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using [tool name, e.g., SQL / Power BI]. 
The goal is to explore infection trends, identify high-risk regions, and understand how the virus initially spread among populations.
By working with publicly available COVID-19 datasets, this project demonstrates how data can be used to generate insights, track global cases, and visualize key metrics such as confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time.

## Overview

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later named COVID-19, is a virus from the coronavirus family identified as the cause of a respiratory illness outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China.
Early cases were linked to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting an initial animal-to-human transmission. 
However, as the outbreak progressed, many patients showed no direct link to animal markets, indicating that the virus was also spreading from person to person. 
The exact ease and sustainability of human-to-human transmission were initially unclear, which led to widespread global concern.

yet to answer:
Key questions explored:
- What were the early patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak?
- Which countries reported the most confirmed cases in the initial months?
- How did the number of cases grow over time?

This analysis is intended as a data exploration exercise to strengthen SQL/data visualization skills while learning from a real-world dataset.
